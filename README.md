This project involves developing a machine learning model to perform sentiment analysis on airline-related tweets. Utilizing a Jupyter Notebook environment, the solution implements text preprocessing techniques and builds a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier optimized using Grid Search and cross-validation to achieve high performance in classifying tweets as either positive or negative. The notebook includes detailed steps for data cleaning, feature extraction using TF-IDF, model training, evaluation with ROC curves, and visualization of learning curves. This comprehensive approach provides a valuable tool for airlines to understand customer sentiment and improve service based on actionable insights from social media data.
